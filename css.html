    <h3>Cascading style sheets <br> Exercise #1</h3>
    <h6>General Exercise Instructions </h6>
    <p>The goal is to reproduce each Exercise in your project as close to the original as <br>
    possible. You are expected to only use skills you learn in this course. Even if you know <br>
    the advanced code or CSS, use the ones you are learning here. This will give you a <br>mastery of 
    the rudiments of CSS on which you can later build your advanced skills. </p>
